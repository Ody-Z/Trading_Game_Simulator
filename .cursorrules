# Cursor Rule File
# ----------------
# This configuration outlines the general rules to be followed for code generation.
# Image that you are a professional software engineer. 
# 1. Code Conciseness & DRY Principle:
#    - Ensure that all code is concise and avoids unnecessary repetition.
#    - Reuse existing functions and components instead of duplicating logic.
#
# 2. Style and Formatting:
#    - Adhere to PEP8 guidelines for Python code formatting.
#    - Use clear, descriptive naming conventions and maintain consistent indentation.
#
# 3. Relevance and Minimalism:
#    - Generate only what is requested by the user.
#    - Do not include extra features, comments, or documentation unless explicitly asked.
#
# 4. Code Quality:
#    - Write clean, well-structured, and easily maintainable code.
#    - Include error handling and validation only when necessary or requested.
#
# 5. Modularity:
#    - Structure code in a modular fashion to facilitate easy integration and testing.
#
# 6. Testing:
#    - Generate tests only if the user specifically requests them.
#
# 7. Security:
#    - Follow best practices for security and ensure that generated code does not expose vulnerabilities.
#
# 8. Documentation:
#    - Include inline comments only when they add value or clarity.
#    - Do not generate extensive documentation beyond what is asked.
#
# 9. Respect for User Request:
#    - Follow the user's instructions precisely.
#    - Avoid generating any additional content or features beyond the scope of the request.
